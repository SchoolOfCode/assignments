# Assignments repo
## Overview

This repository will provide assignments that will allow members of the School Of Code cohort to put knowledge into practice. The aim of each assignment will be to take you through the programming concepts you've learnt and implement them into actual software in varying stages of difficulty.

## What to do if I'm struggling

Different programmers are talented at different things regarding software, here's a few things that may help you out:

- Ask somebody for help if you've been struggling to get your code to work for a while, another pair of eyes may just be able to find that dodgy curly bracket that's been missing for the past 10 minutes <span>&#x1F609;</span>
- Try pair programming through a problem <span>&#x1F495;</span>
- Google is your best ~~resource~~ friend now. If you're having a problem it'll be more than likely someone else has experienced the same issue. Great resources you'll find yourself using throughout your development career will be [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/, [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) and many more <span>&#x1F4BB;</span>
- Know when to use what: <br/>
&#9;&#9; - Forums will be useful for when you have an issue with your code, as mentioned before it's more than likely someone else will have had the same issue and posted it online to get a solution <span>&#x1F64F;</span> <br/>
&#9;&#9; - Documentation will be useful for when you'd like to learn more about an inbuilt function of a language or recapping what the function specifically does <span>&#x1F50D;</span> <br/>
&#9;&#9; - Online projects on platforms like Github, JSFiddle and Codepen will be useful for looking at existing projects and exploring how other people have developed sleek products (You may even wish to implement some of these in your own projects) <span>&#x1F60D;</span> <br/>
